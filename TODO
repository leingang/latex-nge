NGE tasks for 3.0 release
=========================

[ ] Fill in worksheet class
    (Should be much like a quiz, just without gradeblanks)

[X] fix the gradeblank bug
    seems to end up in strange places, especially on a front-and-back quiz.
    This might have something to do with the ownpage option to problem.

[-] fix the svnurl bug
    The svninfo package adds code the the page header.  Don't want that.
    Fixed the symptom, not sure about the cause.

[ ] separate source code, unit tests, and examples into their own files

Targeted for 3.1
================
