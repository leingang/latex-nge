%^^A nge.dtx --- the source file for NGEd package
%^^A $Id$
%^^A
%^^A File nge.dtx is the single source file for the entire NGEd
%^^A package: all the LaTeX classes and styles, all the supporting
%^^A files, and all the documentation is generated from it.  The file
%^^A is structured so that each part in it generates some file or a
%^^A group of files related to each  other in the package, while
%^^A comments in that part provide the documentation.
%^^A
%^^A For general description of the package see section README below, for
%^^A installation instructions see section INSTALL, for license and
%^^A copyright notice see section LICENSE.  Alternatively, processing
%^^A this file through LaTeX, i.e. running the command 
%^^A     latex nge.dtx
%^^A will extract the content of these sections into files readme.txt,
%^^A install.txt and license.txt, respectively, which can be then
%^^A inspected separately.  This command will also generate other
%^^A files, for details please consult the documentation.

% \maketitle
% \begin{abstract}
%   The \nged{} bundle is a set of \LaTeXe classes and packages,
%   providing a unified typographic support for the entire line of
%   educational materials: from tests and solutions to course
%   assessments.  Its naturally oriented toward mathematics courses
%   but it is not specific to them.

% \section{Introduction}
%
%
% \subsection{Goals}
%\todo{Rewrite!}
% The \nged{}bundle classes and packages should be
%
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item \emph{beautiful}
%   \item \emph{useful} 
%   \item \emph{flexible} items should be configurable
%   \item \emph{modular} This is why the several different packages for different uses
%   \item \emph{lazy} We will use other packages when they are useful
% \end{itemize}
%
% \subsection{Other classes which do this kind of thing}
%\todo{Expand!}
% Look at examdesign, mathexam, and exam.
% 
% \subsection*{Introduction}
%
% \subsubsection*{Conventions, adopted in is this manual}
% The word ``package'' is ambiguous and its meaning varies with the
% context.  In this manual it may mean any of the following:
% \begin{description}
% \item[\LaTeX{} package:] a collection of \LaTeX{} styles and classes,
%   designed to work well together and which may depend on each other.
%   Files, comprising a \LaTeX{} package are usually located in a
%   common directory of a \LaTeX{} distribution tree.  In particular,
%   all files of \LaTeX{} package \nged, described in this
%   manual share are located in directory \ngefile{nge}.
% \item[Distribution package:] a \LaTeX{} package together with its
%   documentation and other supporting files (e.g. a list of files
%   with their md5 checksums).  Distribution packages are frequently
%   taylored to one of popular \TeX{} distributions, such as teTeX or
%   liveTeX and most of them are available for download in archived
%   forms at large Internet repositories, such as CTAN.\fixme{CTAN address here}
% ^^A When this package is released and accepted to CTAN, uncommment
% ^^A the following lines and insert the appropriate address.
% \iffalse (this is meta-comment)
%  In particular, the current version of \nged, documented in
%  this manual, is available for download on CTAN
%  and various CTAN mirrors (see \ctanpackage{}).
%   This distribution package does not actually contain any \LaTeX{} class or
%   style files, they are generated automatically during package installation.
% \fi
% \item[Source package:] a collection of files and tools necessary for
%   the production and further development of the corresponding
%   \LaTeX{} package together with its supporting materials.  Source
%   package may also include various configuration files for tools,
%   package maintainers and developers use during the development process.
% \end{description}
% Most of the time this ambiguity does not lead to confusion, since
% the intented meaning of word ``package'' is clear from the context.
% In section \ref{sec:user} ``package'' usually means the \LaTeX{}
% \nged{} package and in section \ref{sec:admin} ``package''
% usually means the distribution package \ngefile{nge}.
%
% \subsection{History and changes}
%
% M.\ Leingang first wrote the exam class in 2003 and has developed it
% in stages since then.  Other pieces have been developed along the
% way, too.  In 2009 D.\ Kosygin refactored the package and its
% documentation.  Version 3.0 has been released to public and uploaded
% on CTAN on\fixme{date here}

%
% This section discusses \nged{} distribution package as

% \section{Source}
% \label{sec:source}
% 
% This section discusses the collection of files and tools used in
% generation and development of \nged{} bundle, that is, in
% terms of conventions in the beginning of this manual, the
% \emph{source package} \nged.  We shall refer to files in
% \nged{} source package as \nged{} \emph{sources} or
% simply \emph{the sources}.
%
% \subsection{Main source file: \ngedtx{}}
% \label{sec:source-dtx}
%
% 
% File \ngedtx{} is the single source file for the entire
% \nged{} package: all the \LaTeX{} classes and styles, all the
% supporting files, and all of the documentation is generated from it.
% The consists mostly of \LaTeX{} code together with copious comments
% which provide the source for the documentation.  The file is
% structured so that each part in it generates some file or a group of
% files related to each other in the package.
%
%
%
% \subsection{Generation of \LaTeX{} files and other files:
%   \ngefile{nge.ins}}
% \label{sec:source-ins}
%
% In order to avoid duplication of effort, most of the package files
% are generated from \ngedtx{} by running various programs on
% it. In particular, running \TeX{} on \ngedtx{} generates
% \ngefile{nge.sty} and all the class and style files.  Similarly,
% running \TeX{} on \ngefile{nge.ins} generates all the class and
% style files, but not \ngefile{nge.ins} itself, in order to avoid
% vicious loops.  Setting the appropriate file structure takes some
% effort, but once it is in place, adding to it is not very difficult.
%
%
% \subsection{Documentation}
% \label{sec:source-documentation}
%
% \LaTeX{} code for each class and style file must be placed in a
% separate subsection of section \ref{sec:code} together with detailed
% explanations of its structure.  The title of this section is just
% the name of this class or style file.  In addition there must be a
% subsection of section \ref{sec:user} with the same title, discussing
% with examples how to use it.
%
% \section{Development notes and history}
% \label{sec:dev}
%
% Understanding the structure of a mature
% software package frequently is not an easy task.
% This section documents the entire design of \nged{} package and the
% history of its development.   After
% several cycles of development such a package may consist of several,
% (sometimes many) sophisticated parts interacting is subtle and
% complex.  I\footnote[1]{\label{footnote:1}DK} find it helpful to
% document the entire process of development from the scratch, stage
% by stage, introducing components of the design and implementation
% one by one.  This way it is easier to comprehend (or recall after
% prolonged interruption) the underlying structure of the package and
% the logic of its evolution.  This section is written for my own
% benefit in the first place and bearing in mind a possibility that
% someone else may find it useful too.  The exposition here is akin to
% an exposition of a physical theory.  It does not reflect the
% chronological order of development of ideas and tools, but instead
% offers a coherent path, leading from one idea to another.
%
% \subsection{The purpose of \nged}
% \label{sec:dev-overview}
%
% I\footnotemark[1]\fixme view \nged{} as a tool of teacher's personal
% toolkit in an environment where teaching happens on an industrial
% scale: a large school, a college with large classes, etc\dots.  This
% tool provides typographic support for the entire lifetime of a
% course taught, from its development stage through periodic
% assesments to a complete bank of materials: assignments, tests,
% handouts for students, notes for teachers and internal
% documentation.  In an ideal teaching environment \nged{} will be
% complemented by a database with a bank of questions, problems,
% tasks, and other materials, crossreferenced by subjects, topics,
% keywords, difficulty level and so on, and teaching support system,
% which automates as much as possible daily routine tasks such as
% distribution and administration of tests, grade processing and
% anything else which which may be reliably delegated to machines and
% computers.
%
% \nged{} should make it possible to concentrate on development of
% course structure, preparation of its materials without worrying too
% much about uniformity and consistency of the appearence of all the
% documents.  For example, preparation of exams, their solutions for
% students, rubric notes for graders, postmortem discussions for
% instructors and assessments for course designers could be possible
% with selection of a few virtual switches applied to the contents of
% the course, which integrates the printed output with other course
% materials under the same typographic theme.
%
% On the other hand \nged{} must be flexible enough to allow
% customization of such themes sa desired.  In addition the package
% should provide a set of sensible defaults which work well out of the
% box and supply an easily extensible theme, which may serve as a
% basis for derivation of other themes, taylored to particular needs
% of course designer.
%
% \subsection{Design and implementation decisions}
% \label{sec:dev-design}
%
% \nged{} grew naturally out of design of tests and course materials
% in mathematical courses, and there is a widely followed tradition of
% using \LaTeX{} and other \TeX{}-derived programs for typesetting
% mathematics.  It is then a straightforward decision to develop
% \nged{} as a \LaTeX{} package at the same time keeping an eye for a
% possibility of extending it later to other \TeX-breeds, such as
% ConTeXt.  
%
% Package \nged{} will be developed following standards and
% conventions of \texlive{}
% distribution\footnote{\url{http://www.tug.org/texlive/}} with the
% ultimate goal of making it available for public download on the
% Comprehensive TeX Archive Network\footnote{CTAN,
%   \url{http://www.ctan.org}}.  \nged{} should integrate well with
% \texlive{} distribution.  In particular \nged{} in its default
% configuration must not rely on any package outside for this
% distribution neither in application of its classes and style files,
% nor in generation of package documentation.
% 
% The released version of \emph{\nged{} distribution package},
% intended for upload on CTAN, should consist of two main files:
% \ngedtx{} and \ngefile{nge.ins}, supplemented with user
% documentation in PDF and other supporting files.  File
% \ngedtx{} will contain the \LaTeX{} code of all class and
% style files in the package and file \ngefile{nge.ins} will be the
% installation script, which extracts all the \LaTeX{} files from
% \ngedtx{} and installs them in the appropriate places of
% \texlive{} distribution.  File \ngedtx{} must also provide
% sources for \nged{} user manual and possibly other documents related
% to the package.
% 
% \nged{} development will follow the principle of creative lazyness:
% no reinvention of wheels, if some task is done well by another
% \texlive{} package, this task should be delegated to it.
% Duplication of text will also be avoided as much as possible: the
% best way to keep two blocks of text or code identical is to insert
% the same source twice.  Finally, the best way to work rapidly is to
% think slowly and provide plenty of explanations.  The package will
% have documented as much as possible, even its own documentation.
%
% Thus \nged{} will be implemented as follows.  All the \LaTeX{}
% sources together with their documentation and sources of all the
% supporting files for distribution package will be contained in the
% single source file \ngedtx{}.  File \ngedtx{} will
% be structured so that all the parts of the distribution package for
% upload on CTAN, including the installation script \ngefile{nge.ins}
% will be extracted from \ngedtx{} with the help of
% \docstrip{} utility.  File \ngedtx{} will also document its
% own structure.  Thus \ngedtx{} is the only source file of
% \nged{} distribution package.
% 
% The generation and development of \nged{} package will be aided by a
% make file \ngefile{Makefile}, which will be evolved in parallel with
% \nged{}.  This makefile will not be a part of \nged{} distribution
% package, but it will be a part of \nged{} source package.  Its
% development will be also documented in appropriate detail in
% \ngedtx{}.  Thus \ngedtx{} and \ngefile{Makefile}
% are the only two files of \emph{\nged{} source package}.  These two
% files together with \LaTeX{} packages, required for application of
% all \nged{} class and style files and generation of all \nged{}
% documentation form \emph{\nged{} development package}.
%
% \nged{} must provide three types of documentation: end user manual,
% which discusses how to use \LaTeX{} package, administrator manual,
% which deals with installation and configuration questions, and
% developers manual, which discusses the maintenance and further
% development of the package.  In addition, maintainers of \nged{} may
% have their private documentation, which, for obvious reasons, is not
% discussed here.
% 
% Documentation of \nged{} must provide for several entry points into
% the package: a user, trying to decide whether the package could be
% useful, may begin with reading the manual, available as a PDF file
% on CTAN.  A system administrator may start with reading the file
% \ngefile{README.txt} in the distribution package.  A \LaTeX{}
% programmer may start reading the source file \ngedtx{} directly.  In
% all these cases clear and concise instructions must be placed near
% the beginning telling where to find or how to build the complete
% documentation.  Chains of references must be short and their length
% should not exceed one in most of the cases and must never exceed
% three.  It is better to tolerate some duplication of documentation,
% than to force the user to chase one reference after another.
% 
% \nged{} development package will be placed under version control in
% a Subversion repository at \ngedsvnroot.
%
% Other design decisions pertinent to particular features of \nged{}
% will be made below as such a necessity arises.
%
% \subsection{Main source file: \ngedtx{}}
% \label{sec:dev-dtx}
%
% We begin with empty file \ngedtx{} and introduce its structure step
% by step adding more and more details.  Contrary to the common
% approach, when \LaTeX{} code is developed by introducing more and more
% parts of it which are finally extracted into a class or style file,
% the exposition in this section is build around various pieces of
% \emph{quoted} code, which were extracted from other parts of this
% file.
%
% Let us summarize the requirements for \ngedtx{} formulated in
% section \ref{sec:dev-design}.  File \ngedtx{} contains \LaTeX{} code
% for all \nged{} class and style files together with their
% documentation.  It also contains sources of all the supporting files
% of \nged{} distribution package and their documentation.  And
% finally, it contains its own documentation too, part of which is
% provided by this section.  We shall adopt the following structure of
% \ngedtx.  The file will consist of two parts: head and body
%\iffalse
%<*hide>
%\fi
% \begin{Verbatim}[frame=single,commandchars=\\\{\}]
\meta{head}
\meta{body}
% \end{Verbatim}
%\iffalse
%</hide>
%\fi
% Part \meta{head} contains the sources of all the supporting files,
% while part \meta{body} contains all the \LaTeX{} sources for class
% and style files, their documentation and the package documentation
% too.
%
% In order to combine \LaTeX{} code and its documentation in one file
% we shall use \LaTeX{} package
% \latexpackage{doc}\footnote{\texcatalogueentry{doc}}.  The \LaTeX{}
% code for \nged{} class and style files in file \ngedtx{} is marked
% up according to \latexpackage{doc} conventions and is interpspersed
% with comments, which serve as \LaTeX{} source for documentation.
% Actual \nged{} class and style files are extracted from \ngedtx{} by
% \docstrip{}\footnote{\texcatalogueentry{docstrip}} utility and the
% package documentation produced by processing \ngedtx{} with
% \LaTeX{}.  Thus \ngedtx{} has the form
%\iffalse
%<*hide>
%\fi
% \begin{Verbatim}[frame=single,commandchars=\\\{\}]
\textit{sources for supporting files in \nged{} distribution package}
\textit{\latexpackage{doc} configuration}
\textit{latex code for classes and styles code with \docstrip{} markup}
  \textit{and their documentation}
\textit{\nged{} documentation source}
% \end{Verbatim}
%\iffalse
%</hide>
%\fi
% The detailed structure of each part is discussed in subsections
% below.
%
% \subsubsection{The driver}
% \label{sec:dev-dtx-driver}
%
% By convention, the part of file \ngedtx{}, containing
% \latexpackage{doc} configuration is called the \emph{driver}.  We
% shall use in the driver \LaTeX{} class \latexclass{ltxdoc}, which
% loads \latexpackage{doc} automatically.  Thus initially the driver
% looks as follows
% \VerbatimInput{driver-skel.tex}
% The lines between |\begin{document}| and |\end{document}| contain
% commands for \latexpackage{doc} to read and process files with the
% code and documentation.  In our case there is only one file ---
% \ngedtx{} itself and we use command
% \VerbatimInput{driver-body}
% But running |latex| on file
% \VerbatimInput{driver-2.dtx}
% will produce an error, since after reading line
% \VerbatimInput{driver-body}
% \LaTeX{} will begin reading \ngedtx{} from the beginning and during
% the second processing of this file \LaTeX{} again sees
% |\documentclass{ltxdoc}|.  In order to avoid this error everything
% between |\documentclass{ltxdoc}| and |\end{document}| in \ngedtx
% needs to be concealed from \LaTeX{} on the second reading.  
%
% In ordinary \TeX{} one could conceal parts of a source file from
% reading by ``commenting out''.  If an unquoted \% sign occurs in a
% line of a tex source file the first occurance of this sign together
% with everything following it till the end of the line is considered
% a comment and is skipped by \TeX{} during the processing.
% Alternatively, we can tell \TeX{} to skip a block of lines by
% placing it inside a conditional statement whose condition is never
% fulfilled, that is between |\iffalse| and |\fi| commands.  \LaTeX{}
% follows the same conventions as \TeX{}.  But commenting out the
% entire driver or placing it between |\iffalse| and |\fi| creates
% another problem.  Lines
% \VerbatimInput{driver-3.dtx}
% are concealed from \LaTeX{} on the first run too and they are never
% seen by \LaTeX{} at all.
%
% In order to make the driver visible to \LaTeX{} on the first run and
% invisible on the second run, when the command |\DocInput{\jobname}|
% is processed, we can use the fact, that package \latexpackage{doc}
% changes the meaning of character \%.  With \latexpackage{doc} loaded
% \% no longer indicates the beginning of a comment, it is treated by
% \LaTeX{} in the same way a blank space is treated.  The driver
% \VerbatimInput{driver-4.dtx}
% is processed by \LaTeX{} correctly and produces no errors: it is
% seen by \LaTeX{} on the initial pass over \ngedtx{} and everything
% between |%\iffalse| and |%\fi| is skipped on the second pass.
%
% \subsubsection{Use of comments}
% \label{sec:dev-dtx-comments}
%
% In the section \ref{sec:dev-dtx-driver} we concealed the driver of
% \ngedtx{} from \latexpackage{doc} by placing it between commands
% |%\iffalse| and |%\fi|. We shall use this method of commenting
% systematically during the preparation of \ngedtx.  Comments in
% \ngedtx{} are used mostly to conceal various parts of this file from
% \LaTeX{} and not to provide detailed information about the file
% structure.  The latter purpose is served by the document you are
% currently reading.
%
% Every part of \ngedtx{} which needs to be concealed from \LaTeX{}
% will be either commented out with \% signs or placed between
% |\iffalse| and |\fi| commands.  Similarly, every part which needs to
% be concealed from \latexpackage{doc} package during the stage, when
% will be placed between |%\iffalse| and |%\fi| commands.
% With the help of these techniques it is possible to achieve all four
% possible combinations of visibility and invisibility of a particular
% part of \ngedtx{} to \LaTeX{} on the first pass over \ngedtx{} and
% \LaTeX{} on the second pass with \latexpackage{doc} already
% loaded.
%
% Beware, however that using |\iffalse| and |\fi| or |%\iffalse| and
% |%\fi| for commenting purposes requires care, since \TeX{} still reads
% everything following |\iffalse| in search of a matching |\fi|.  This
% may lead to unexpected results, if \TeX, for example, encounters a
% construct |\iffalse...\fi...\fi|.  The first |\fi| is not ignored,
% instead it matches the preceding |\iffalse|, thus ending a comment.
% When \TeX{} encounters the second |\fi|, this may result in an
% error, if this |\fi| does not match any prior |\iffalse| or the
% second |\fi| may match some prior |\iffalse| for which it was not
% intended.
% 
% In addition \latexpackage{doc} recognises sequence of characters
% |^^A| as the beginning of a comment and skips everything, following
% the first occurence of this unquoted character string till the end
% of the line.  This string has the same relation to the pair
% |%\iffalse| and |%\fi| in \latexpackage{doc} package, as character
% |%| to the pair |\iffalse| and |\fi|.  We conceal from
% \latexpackage{doc} those parts of \ngedtx{} which provide sources
% for other files in \nged{} distribution package with the help of
% |%\iffalse| and |%\fi|, and use |^^A| for short comments in
% \ngedtx, helping to separate one part of the file from another and
% serving as reminders of various conventions adopted during the
% development.
% 
% \subsubsection{Configuration of \latexpackage{doc} package}
% \label{sec:dev-dtx-doc}
% 
% After the line |\documentclass{ltxdoc}| we add configuration
% commands for \latexpackage{doc}
% \VerbatimInput{driver-config.tex}
% which turn on indexing of macros and refer to line numbers of code
% where they were used.  We also tell \latexpackage{doc} to record
% history of changes, made in the file.  These configuration commands
% for \latexpackage{doc} are also supplemented by the command
% \VerbatimInput{stopeventually.dtx}
% telling \LaTeX{} to perform appropriate actions at the end of
% typesetting.  Configuration of \latexpackage{doc} used in processing
% \ngedtx{} may by changed by the user with the help of 
% configuration file \latexfile{ltxdoc.cfg}.  For details see
% section \ref{sec:user-manual}.
%
% Later we shall add to \latexpackage{doc} configuration commands in
% the preamble of the driver other commands, loading various \LaTeX{}
% packages, configuring them, and defining custom macros.
%
% Right after the driver we also place commands
% \VerbatimInput{checksum.dtx}
% providing rudimentary error control for \ngedtx{} during network
% transmissions.  Thus the initial version of \ngedtx{} takes the form
% \VerbatimInput{nge-1.dtx}
% User documentation will go before |\StopEventually| command and the
% code and package documentation will follow this command.
%
% \subsubsection{\docstrip{} markup}
% \label{sec:dev-dtx-docstrip-markup}
%
% \docstrip{} is used in \nged{} for two purposes.  All the class and
% style files for \nged{} are extracted from \ngedtx{} with the help
% of \docstrip{} utility.  Other parts of \ngedtx{} are extracted with
% the help of \docstrip{} too.  Some of these extracted parts become
% components of \nged{} distribution package, some are inserted
% verbatim in the package documentation as quotations.  The latter
% solves the consistency problem: it ensures that the quotation in the
% documentation is indeed identical with the part of the code to which
% it is referring.
%
% The extraction of parts is done with the help of \docstrip{}
% |\generate| command.  The details are given in sections
% \ref{sec:dev-dtx-docstrip-ins},
% \ref{sec:dev-dtx-docstrip-extraction}.  In this section we shall
% discuss the structure of \ngedtx{} from the point of view of
% \docstrip.
%
% In its default configuration \docstrip{}, when run on a \TeX{} file,
% removes all the lines, which begin with a single |%| sign and
% outputs other lines literally.  There is also an important
% exception: lines beginning with |%%| are not stripped, they are also
% output literally.  For other details see \docstrip{}
% documentation\fixme[reference].
%
% In order to simplify generation of multiple files from a single
% source, \docstrip{} makes possible conditional extraction of lines.
% This is done by giving |\generate| command an options list with with
% which the input file is processed 
%\iffalse
%<*hide>
%\fi
% \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\+\[\]]
\generate{\file{+textit[file.out]}{\from{+textit[file.in]}{+textit[opt1,+dots,optn]}}} 
% \end{Verbatim}
%\iffalse
%</hide>
%\fi Every line of \latexfile{file.in} is also supplied with a boolean
% expression of options in disjunctive normal form.  Such expressions
% are called by \docstrip{} authors \emph{guards}.  One may view
% quards as boolean functions which depend on boolean variables
% \textit{opt1}, \dots, \textit{optn} and may depend on other boolean
% variables (options) too.  The list of options, given to |\generate|
% command tells, which variables in \meta{guard} evaluate to |true|.
% All other variables in the guard evaluate to |false|.  Then
% \latexfile{file.in} is read line by line and the extraction decision
% is made according to the following criteria\footnote{Warning: these
%   conclusions are based on my understanding and interpretation of
%   \docstrip{} manual.  I have not studied \docstrip{} code itself.
%   In cases where there is any doubt about the accuracy of this
%   description, it is strongly advised to try experiment with
%   \docstrip{}.}.
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item A line is a \emph{comment line} if it begins with |%| which is
%   not followed by a guard or another |%|.  All the comment lines are
%   stripped.
% \item If the line begins with a guard \meta{guard}, possibly
%   prefixed with |%|, then boolean expression \meta{guard} is
%   evaluated according to the standard rules of boolean logic.  All
%   the boolean variables from the list of options \textit{opt1},
%   \dots, \textit{optn} evaluate to |true|, any other boolean
%   variables, occuring in \meta{guard} evaluate to |false|.  If
%   boolean function $\meta{guard}$ evaluates to |true|, then
%   everything following the guard to the end of the line is
%   extracted.  Otherwise the line is skipped.
% \item If the line is not a comment line and it has no guard, it is
%   extracted unconditionally, that is \emph{always}
%   extracted\footnote{This criterion is strikingly different from the
%     usual treatment of disjunctive normal forms (DNFs) in
%     mathematical logic, where an empty DNF always evaluates to
%     |false|.  Interpreting the empty DNF as a constant boolean
%     function with value |false| would mean that failing to provide a
%     guard for a line would make this line effectively unextractable.
%     Naturally, no matter how consistent it is with DNFs' notations,
%     this is not the behaviour one expects from an extraction
%     process.  Even when no options for extraction are specified we
%     expect the line to be extracted unless it is a comment line.
%     But it is precisely this deviation from the standard
%     interpretation of DNFs, which makes creation of extraction rules
%     harder than necessary.  A different set of defaults is forced
%     upon the language of DNFs, which make me wonder, whether the
%     initial choice of the language for boolean expressions was well
%     thought through.  Conjunctive normal forms (CNFs) look like a
%     more suitable alternative here, but dealing with CNFs is much
%     harder for humans than dealing with DNFs.  Is there a better
%     form of presenting options for extractions, which makes it easy
%     to comprehend by humans and consistent with set-theoretic
%     operations?}.
% \item A line which begins with |%%| is considered a comment line,
%   marked for extraction.  It is processed for extraction in the same
%   way as a line with an empty guard: it is extracted entirely,
%   together with the leading |%%|.
% \end{enumerate}
% If a block of contiguous lines has to be marked for extraction with
% the same guard \meta{guard}, instead of marking each line with
% \meta{guard}, one can enclose the entire block between two anchors
% \meta{*guard} and \meta{/guard}, produced from \meta{guard} with
% modifiers |*| and |/|.  Guard \meta{guard} with guard modifier |*|
% marks the beginning of the block, marked with \meta{guard}, and
% \meta{guard} with guard modifier |/| marks the end of this block.
% Simple guards may be nested.  Constructs like
%\iffalse
%<*hide>
%\fi
% \begin{Verbatim}
<*A>
<B> some text   
</A>
% \end{Verbatim}
%\iffalse
%</hide>
%\fi
% and
%\iffalse
%<*hide>
%\fi
% \begin{Verbatim}
<*A>
<*B>
 some text
</B>   
</A>
% \end{Verbatim}
%\iffalse
%</hide>
%\fi
% are equivalent to 
%\iffalse
%<*hide>
%\fi
% \begin{Verbatim}
<A&B> some text
% \end{Verbatim}
%\iffalse
%</hide>
%\fi
% provided that expression |<A&B>| is well defined for \docstrip{}.
%
% While preparing \ngedtx{} we adopt the following conventions.  In
% order to avoid inadvertent extraction of lines into multiple files,
% \emph{all} \LaTeX{} code will be marked up with guards.  Most of the
% quards will have mnemonic names, clearly relating them to the part
% of \ngedtx{} they are guarding.  Here is, for example, the driver of
% \ngedtx{} with appropriate guards incorporated
% \VerbatimInput{driver-template.dtx}
% Note that quards |<*driver>| and |</driver>| are not seen by
% \LaTeX{}, since they are prepended by the comment sign |%|.  These
% guards are not seen by \latexpackage{doc} package either, since the
% entire driver is placed between |%\iffalse| and |%\fi|.
%
% Concealing guards from \latexpackage{doc} may require additional
% care.  For example, the line
%\iffalse
%<*hide>
%\fi
% \begin{Verbatim}
%<guard> some text   
% \end{Verbatim}
%\iffalse
%</hide>
%\fi 
% will be processed by \docstrip{} correctly: if option |<guard>| is
% given, | some text| will be output, and the line will be ignored
% otherwise.  Similarly, this line will be ignored by \LaTeX{},
% because it begins with a comment character |%|.  But
% \latexpackage{doc} will see this line and it will be typeset as\\
% \leftline{<guard> some text}
% which presumably was not our intention.  In order to conceal the
% guard from \LaTeX{} and \latexpackage{doc} it has to be placed
% between |%\iffalse| and |%\fi| commands.  Hence the correct way to
% prepare the line above for typesetting by \LaTeX{} is
%\iffalse
%<*hide>
%\fi
% \begin{Verbatim}
%\iffalse
%<*guard>
%\fi
 some text   
%\iffalse
%</guard>
%\fi 
% \end{Verbatim}
%\iffalse
%</hide>
%\fi 
% If we want to conceal this line from \LaTeX{} and make it visible to
% \latexpackage{doc} only, we can prepend | some text| with |%|.
% \iffalse
%<*hide>
%\fi
% \begin{Verbatim}
%\iffalse
%<*guard>
%\fi
% some text   
%\iffalse
%</guard>
%\fi 
% \end{Verbatim}
%\iffalse
%</hide>
%\fi 
% This does typeset the line above correctly, but produces another
% problem: even with option |guard| given explicitely \docstrip{} will
% view  line |% some text| as a comment line and it will strip it off.
% If we still want this line to be in \docstrip{} output, we have to
% prepend it not with one |%|, but with |%%|.  
%\iffalse
%<*hide>
%\fi
% \begin{Verbatim}
%\iffalse
%<*guard>
%\fi
%% some text   
%\iffalse
%</guard>
%\fi 
% \end{Verbatim}
%\iffalse
%</hide>
%\fi 
% This way, as explained above, \docstrip{}\footnote{provided that
%   docstrip is in its default configuration} will consider line
% |%% some text| as a comment,
% intended for extraction and it will be extracted from the file.
% That is why the lines for |\CheckSum|, |\CharacterTable|,
% |\StopEventually| and |\Finale| in the examples in section
% \ref{sec:dev-dtx-doc} were prepended not with one, but with two |%|
% signs.  This way they are processed correctly by both
% \latexpackage{doc} package and \docstrip{}.  
%
% Guard |<hide>| will be used for marking up parts of \ngedtx{} which
% are never to be extracted with \docstrip{}, with the explicit
% assumption, that option |hide| will \emph{never} be given to
% |\generate| command.  Guard |<hide>| is used in particular to
% conceal lines containing |<guard>| in examples above.  Here is how
% the source for the first of the three examples above looks like
% \iffalse
%<hide-example>%\iffalse
%<hide-example>%<*hide>
%<hide-example>%\fi
%<hide-example>% \begin{Verbatim}
%<hide-example>\iffalse
%<hide-example><*guard>
%<hide-example>\fi
%<hide-example> some text   
%<hide-example>\iffalse
%<hide-example></guard>
%<hide-example>\fi 
%<hide-example>% \end{Verbatim}
%<hide-example>%\iffalse
%<hide-example>%</hide>
%<hide-example>%\fi 
% \fi
% \VerbatimInput{hide-example.dtx}
% There is also a simple way to place in docstrip output a line which
% begins with exactly one |%| character, provided, that this line does
% not need to be processed by \latexpackage{doc}.  For this it
% suffices to place the line between |%\iffalse| and |%\fi| commands and
%  prepend the entire line with an appropriate guard.
%\iffalse
%<*hide>
%\fi
% \begin{Verbatim}
%\iffalse
%<guard>% some text   
%\fi 
% \end{Verbatim}
%\iffalse
%</hide>
%\fi
% After running \docstrip{} with option |guard| on the source, line\\
% |% some text|\\
% will be extracted into another file, whose contents may be then
% quoted verbatim with the help of |\VerbatimInput| command.
% This is how the example above with a hidden |<guard>| was
% produced.
%
% The rest of the file \ngedtx{} consists of parts, marked up with the
% help of the techniques extensively discussed above.  In particular,
% every subsection of section \ref{sec:code} is enclosed between a
% pair of anchors, whose guard name is derived from the appropriate
% class or style file, derived in this section.  For example, entire
% subsection \ref{sec:code-ngemin} is enclosed between anchors
% |<*ngemin>| and |</ngemin>|.  Similarly, the part of \ngedtx{} file,
% which serves as the source for readme.txt file of \nged{}
% distribution package is placed between anchors |<*readme>| and
% |</readme>|, and so on\dots.  In addition to guard |<hide>|, which
% is never issued as option to \docstrip{}, we also use several
% guards, which are common for some groups of generated files.  For
% example, guard |<code>| marks up the part, which is common for all
% the \LaTeX{} class and style files.  It includes in particular
% version information for each file.
%
% \subsubsection{Extracting parts of itself}
% \label{sec:dev-dtx-docstrip-extraction}
%
% At the end of section \ref{sec:dev-dtx-docstrip-markup} we have
% discussed, how various pieces of \ngedtx{} may be marked up for
% extraction with \docstrip{}.  Some of the extracted pieces are later
% inserted in the documentation verbatim, next to the explanations of
% their structure and purpose.  Other extracted pieces of \ngedtx{}
% become part of \nged{} distribution package.
%
% We place \TeX{} commands, controlling the extraction, in the very
% beginning of \ngedtx{}.  These are the first lines \LaTeX{} sees and
% processes even before seeing |\documentclass| command.  This way all
% the parts of \ngedtx{} are extracted before they are needed for
% quoting at later stages of processing.
%
% 
% The extraction is done with the help of \docstrip{} utility, so we
% load it first.
% \VerbatimInput{ext-docstrip.dtx}
% Then we configure \docstrip{} to extract files silently, overwriting them if
% they necessary and tell it to prepend or  append nothing  to
% extracted pieces.
% \VerbatimInput{ext-mock-config.dtx}
% In order to conceal the extraction commands from \latexpackage{doc}
% package, we need to place them between |%\iffalse| and |%\fi|
% commands.  So the beginning of \ngedtx{} now takes the form
% \VerbatimInput{ext-skel.dtx}
% Now it remains only to add file generation commands.  The code below
% extracts pieces of \ngedtx{} for quoting them later in the
% documentation.
% \VerbatimInput{ext-examples.dtx}
% File \latexfile{canary.txt} checks for lines with \LaTeX{} commands
% without \docstrip{} guards.  If there are no such lines it will be
% empty.
%
% In the same way one can add commands for generation other files in
% \nged{} distribution package.
%
% \subsubsection{File \latexfile{nge.ins}}
% \label{sec:dev-dtx-docstrip-ins}
%
% File \latexfile{nge.ins} is part of \nged{} distribution package.
% Its purpose is to generate all class and style files from
% \ngedtx{}.  Its structure is similar to the structure of code at the
% end of section \ref{sec:dev-dtx-docstrip-extraction}.  But there
% docstrip has different configuration in it. First of all\fixme[complete]
% \VerbatimInput{ins-1.dtx}
% Furthermore \fixme[complete]
% \VerbatimInput{ins-texlive.dtx}
% In addition, all the class and style files have license and
% copyright notice inserted in them during the generation process.
% This is achieved by supplying appropriate preamble in
% \latexfile{nge.ins}:
% \VerbatimInput{ins-preamble.dtx}
% Then file generation commands are issued
% \VerbatimInput{ins-body.dtx}
% followed by installation message and ``end of job'' command
% \VerbatimInput{ins-tail.dtx}
% 
% \subsubsection{Extracting everything from \ngedtx{}}
% \label{sec:dev-dtx-docstrip-all}
%
% Since the structure of \latexfile{nge.ins} is so similar to the
% extraction code in the beginning of \ngedtx{}, quoted in section
% \ref{sec:dev-dtx-docstrip-extraction}, it is tempting to avoid
% duplication of efforts and arrange file extraction commands in the
% beginning of \ngedtx{} so that file \latexfile{nge.ins} is generated
% automatically, with its preamble extracted from the part of
% \ngedtx{}, which contains the text of copyright notice and license.
%
% This is achieved by interspersing \docstrip{} configuration and
% extraction commands in the beginning of \ngedtx{} with the text of
% copyright notice and license, and marking them up appropriately with
% various guards.  It is also possible to obtain the same result by
% keeping docstrip commands and license text in separate parts of
% \ngedtx, and generating \latexfile{nge.ins} with the help of several
% |\from| commands.  We do not use this approach for reasons which
% will be given below.
%
% First we begin by placing all the \docstrip{} configuration end extraction
% commands  inside a \TeX{} group, in order to avoid interference of
% \docstrip{} definitions with \LaTeX{} definitions, loaded later.
% \VerbatimInput{ext-head.dtx}
% Then we load docstrip and its configuration commands.
% \VerbatimInput{ext-docstrip.dtx}
% Since configuration commands for file extraction from \ngedtx{} and
% \latexfile{nge.ins} differ from each other, some of them need to be
% concealed from \docstrip{}, while others have to be concealed from
% \LaTeX{}.  This is achieved with the help of |<ins>| guard, marking
% parts for extraction into \latexfile{nge.ins}.
% \VerbatimInput{ext-fullconfig.dtx}
% In the same way we configure the preamble.  Different preambles a
% needed for generation of class and style files, for package
% distribution files and for code examples.  Therefore, next we place
% in \ngedtx{} the text of license, marked up for extraction into
% preamble of \latexfile{nge.ins} and also into a separate file.
% \VerbatimInput{ext-preamble.dtx}
% Next we give file generation commands\footnote{File generation
%   commands quoted here correspond to the development version of
%   \ngedtx.  In the version of \ngedtx{}, distributed with \nged{}
%   package some of these commands are commented out in order to avoid
%   overwriting files, distributed with the package.}.
% \VerbatimInput{ext-body.dtx}
% Note that in the code above file generation commands for class and
% style files come first.  Therefore the text of the license given in
% preamble to these command applies to them.  The same preamble is
% also extracted into \latexfile{nge.ins}, which makes class and style
% files, with the help of lines above, identical with class and style
% files, extracted from \ngedtx{} with the help of file
% \latexfile{nge.ins} given in section
% \ref{sec:dev-dtx-docstrip-ins}. Furthermore, the same preamble
% applies to file \latexfile{nge.ins} itself, extracted from \ngedtx{}
% by the code above.  It is precisely this ability to use the same
% text of license several times which affected our decision to
% intertwine \docstrip{} commands with license text in \ngedtx{}.
%
% Extraction commands are followed by the rest of \latexfile{nge.ins}
% contents, after which we close the \TeX{} group.
% \VerbatimInput{ext-tail.dtx}
% The |\ifx| conditional above checks whether accidentally or
% intentionally the file generation commands were processed with plain
% \TeX{} and if this is the case, exits.  Otherwise, the \TeX{} group,
% opened in the beginning of this section, is closed and the program
% (presumably \LaTeX{} or its relative) proceeds to read and interpret
% the driver.

% \subsection{Bits and ends}
% \label{sec:dev-misc}
% To be processed.
% \begin{list}{}{Things to do and to think about}
% \item Configure todos in this file
% \item Use svn support too for tags and in latex
% \item Think through font selection for package names, file names and
%   commands issued.
% \item Find a way to incorporate ChangeLog file.
% \item Add style for url references.
% \item Write about mirroring manual parts for user and developer.
% \item Add paragraph about making releases.
% \item When nge.dtx is processed through latex, issue installation
%   instructions in the end, not at the beginning.
% \item Debug index generation
% \item Add possibility to make todo and fixme notes right in the text
% \item Mention in the manual packages which \nged{}uses and what is
%   needed to compile documentation.
% \item update message and sync it with installation instructions.
% \item sync file list with license with what is generated by the
%   package
% \item make a list in the document of all the files, generated by it.
% \item test nge.ins with local docstrip.cfg.
% \item Think through typographic conventions: urls, package names,
%   directories, files, what else?
% \item Combining several documents (exams, quizzes, etc\dots) in one
%   document. Use report class?  \textsf{Doc} package and docstrip?
% \item ``postmortem'' command and environment.
% \item Is there a simple way to keep an up to date manifest.txt?
% \item Is it possible to stop processing nge.dtx, if it is not
%   processed with LateX, without generating any errors?
% \item the package should not depend on files outside \texlive{}
%   distribution.
% \item fix \verb|\showdirectory| call in \meta{ins} section.
% \item Two possibilities --- all problems back to back, or each
%   problem on a new page.  in the latter case an option to provide a
%   space for the answer and option to provide place for a problem
%   grade.
% \item Compile list of problems with totals points in a table.
%   options for placing this table on the front page, standalone table
%   on the second page or on the last page.
% \item multiple variants.  options for solutions, rubrics.  Notes to
%   students and to graders. Assesment notes.
% \item compilation of all course materials under the same title,
%   similar to doc package.
% \item configuration file, where a common theme may be configured.
% \item Rudimentary control over vertical space for problems.
% \item Localization.
% \item Types of problems: multiple choice (circle, underline answer,
%   fill in the blanks), true or false, problems with parts (one
%   level).
% \item examdesign produces multiple (randomized?) versions
% \item Simultaneous generation of exams (with versions), solutions
%   and rubrics in one batch, but in separate files.
% \item most options (where it makes sense) should provide a
%   possibility of manually overriding them, at least in principle.
% \item Multiple instructors, multiple sections -- think what to do in
%   that case.
% \item Write about typographic conventions for the exam (e.g.
%   display style formulas vs. inline style formulas).
% \item in nyu classes may be it is possible to generate pages for
%   scantrone?
% \item partial grading tables?  Not sure whether it is a good idea
% \item use hyperref in PDF mode
% \item provide for bonus problems and points
% \item write a manual with plenty of examples
% \item I think automatic generation of dtx file for release is
%   unavoidable.  But still I would like to break it apart as little
%   as possible.  May be it is possible to keep everything in it and
%   process it conditionally depending on whether it is a release
%   version or a developlment version.  For now I am not going to
%   worry about that.
% \item Write a simple script which guards agains common typos
%   (forgotten braces after macros like \verb|\LaTeX|, repeated words,
%   etc.  Perhaps it should be written in perl.
% \item In addition to system-wide configuration there must be a
%   possibility to configure \nged{} in a single directory, so that it
%   processes all the sources using the common theme, but which may be
%   overriden in individual documents.
% \item Review nged.dtx.  Separate cleanly style and logic.  Must have
%   default behaviour similar to article.cls
% \item Sensible sets of defaults?
% \item Distinguish release package, release tools, release sources,
%   development sources, development tools and personal development
%   environment and structure Makefile accordingly.
% \item Write a short manual for developing too
% \item perhaps it is better to use group environment for sections
%   included conditionally.
% \item Try a docstrip.cfg, so that it is as silent as possible during
%   development
% \item look at svn support in latex and emacs
% \item Add discussion about file structure
% \item write introduction about nged in broad view
% \item produce reportsand assessments in doc style?
% \item Is is possible to make releases with docstrip?
% \item 2 rolling released branches --- stable and dev. also my
%   private development branch kdv.
% \item title pages are just special pages
% \item course name macro, what shall it include?
% \item course info: title, catalog number, timestamp (i.e. academic
%   year, semester, etc, think of a better term in here).
% \item If something is omitted, such as course title, author, etc, it
%   should not be printed, and must not produce error.  The only
%   exception is the title and \verb|maketitle| command.
% \item pdf output may provide something which is not available in dvi
%   format.
% \item when releasing package update checksum
% \item Do we need a bibliography with CTAN URLs for packages?
% \item figure out a way to include draft options conditionally
% \item option for grade table on the back of the last page
% \item two modes for problems: ``exam'' mode and review mode (turn
%   on/off grade totaling, provide or not provide space for marks,
%   check of the problem has several parts on one line, so that there
%   is no clutter, a column of grades for parts (even a little table).
% \item files nge.cfg, ngecourse.def (or courseinfo.def) with sensible
%   defaults, (also ngetheme.cfg?)
% \item Do I need \latexpackage{url} if I already use
%   \latexpackage{hyperref}?
%  \end{list}
%
% Here is the list of todo notes located throughout the text.
% \listoftodos 
% \paragraph{Courses}
% \nged{} is built around one logical entity -- a course.  All the
% documents are unified under course theme.  It is also possible to
% extend this to course sequence, but most of the time it's just one
% course.
% 
% Each course usually has the following metadata associated with it
% \begin{list}{}{course metadata}
% \item Course name (also a short name)
% \item Educational institution
% \item Educational term and year (semester, quarter, trimester, period\dots)
% \item Instructor or multiple instructors with sections.  Possible
% recitations, precepts, problem sessions, labs, run by teaching
% assistants.  There may be graders too.  There may be course
% coordinator or some other administrative figure.  Do we really need
% to provide for all this information?  Not clear.
% \end{list}
% Course documents may include tests (quizzes, exams\dots),
% assignments (homeworks, projects\dots), handouts with various
% information (syllabus, schedules, requirements, \dots). There also
% may be problem solutions, various postmortems, section and
% instructor assesments, course assesments.  All of these documents may
% have titles, dates and authors as well.
