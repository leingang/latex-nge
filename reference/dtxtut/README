This tutorial is intended for advanced LaTeX2e users who want to learn
how to create .ins and .dtx files for distributing their homebrewed
classes and style files.

   skeleton.ins  -- A sample .ins file (generates .sty)
   skeleton.dtx  -- A sample .dtx file (generates .sty)
   cskeleton.ins -- A sample .ins file (generates .cls)
   cskeleton.dtx -- A sample .dtx file (generates .cls)


The author would like to thank the following people (in alphabetical
order) for their suggestions on improving dtxtut and the skeleton
files:
